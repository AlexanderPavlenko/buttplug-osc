# buttplug-osc

Thanks to [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/), this program would allow to control 
~~numerous supported devices~~ at least one which I have via Ableton Live, TC-Data, etc.

## TODO

* ~~Make scanning optional if possible~~ – seems required
* CLI argument for:
    * ✅ Intiface websocket URL
    * ✅ OSC receiver binding IP:port
    * ✅ Device name
    * ✅ Scanning-only mode if device name not provided
* ✅ Reconnect if device temporarily disconnect
* OSC receiver 
* Build for Windows 10
